# FountainWebsite
My first website project! I tackled this with zero experience in web design, and zero experience with HTML and CSS in general. Upon starting this project I had
some minor and basic understanding in C++ and Java. However, coding and only seeing basic, and trivial outputs was not statifsying my taste for a colorful,
creative project. This lead to start the side project of a mock website for a friend who had a dream of owning her own bar in NYC. To help inspire her to pursue
this dream , and to feed my new love of coding, I wanted to create a webiste that simulated a sophisticated, elegant cocktail bar. I hope you enjoy!
